Using [Awesome Window Manager][AWM] for a long time and I loved it. I made a theme for AWM 3.5 by keeping [awesome-copycats][ACP] as a reference and gave the name *ANXIETY*.

Awesome Anxiety is a set of themes which I made to give users a friendly experience with **Awesome Window Manager** and feel elegant towards it.
