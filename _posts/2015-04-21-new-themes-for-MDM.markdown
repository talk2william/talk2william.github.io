[Mint Display Manager ( MDM )][MDM] is a new kind of display manager as it comes with lots of unique features. The most exiciting thing i love about it, is it supports html, css and javascript.

I made two new html themes for MDM with the help of the emulator it provides.
You can find this themes on [github][Themes] under [MIT][mit] license.
